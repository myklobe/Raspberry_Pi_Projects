"# Servo_Projects" 

simple_servo_control is a looping program that moves the servo from neutral, to 0 degrees, to 180 degrees.

I used a basic 9g servo with JR leads

I hooked up the brown ground pin on the servo to the ground ping on the Raspberry Pi

I hooked up the red power wire on the servo to the 5v pin on the the Raspberry Pi

I installed a 330 ohm resistor just off of the orange lead on the servo, then installed the jumper wire to GPIO 7 on the Raspberry Pi
