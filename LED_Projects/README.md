"# LED_Projects" 

This repo is dedicated to the various LED projects I will be working on. 

simple_LED_blink_setup has the LED GPIO setup and On/Off functions

simple_LED_blink is just a random blink program for 3 LEDs

The traffic_light_LED program simply simulates a traffic light operation... Red light, green light, yellow light, timed.
