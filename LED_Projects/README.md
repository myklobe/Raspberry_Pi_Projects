"# LED_Projects" 

This repo is dedicated to the various LED projects I will be working on. 

setupLED.py has the LED GPIO setup and On/Off functions.

simple_LED_blink.py is just a random blink program for 3 LEDs.

The traffic_light_LED.py program simply simulates a traffic light operation... Red light, green light, yellow light, timed.
